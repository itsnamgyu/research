## ML in Computer Architecture Design

_2019 Penney, A Survey of Machine Learning Applied to Computer Architecture Design_

### Points

- Areas: ML is used most successfully in __branch prediction__ and work is being done in these fields
  - Memory prefetching using LSTMs (2019)
  - TLBs based on learned indices (2019) (based on work from Google for DBs)
  - __"RL" based memory controllers (33, 2008) (34, 2012)__
  - Q-learning based DVFS (35, 2015) (uses quantization)
  - __Q-learning based SSD garbage collection (36, 2018)__
  - __Branch Prediction †__
  - NoC (network on chip), system-level optimization (energy optimization, resource management)
  - ML-enabled approximate computing (general function approximation) †
- Analysis of Current Practices
  - Methods: Supervised, reinforcement learning
    - __Supervised: random trees, ANNs__
    - __Reinforcement: (deep) Q-learning__
  - Need to be computationally, spacially efficient for real-world applicatons
  - Various novel hardware implementations w/ tradeoffs †
  - __Hybrid combination__ allows ML part to focus on shortcomings of traditional approaches (25, 2015) (28, 45, 2019)
    - Not explored outside branch prediction ☆
- Future Work
  - Approach: phase-level prediction, multi-agent models (network)
  - Implementation: network pruning, quantization
